Define aliases for your favorite packages, making usage as simple as `crap require monolog`.

![](example.gif)

## Install

PHP 5.6+ or 7.0+ required.

Because using multiple global Composer packages can create dependency conflicts, I recommend using [`consolidation/cgr`](//github.com/consolidation/cgr) over `composer global require`:

``` bash
cgr geekish/crap
```

If you _don't_ mind descending into global dependency hell:

``` bash
composer global require geekish/crap
```

## Usage

To define your aliases (version constraints are optional):

``` bash
crap alias monolog monolog/monolog:^1.21
```

To use your aliases:

``` bash
crap require monolog
crap update monolog
crap remove monolog
```

To remove an alias:

``` bash
crap unalias monolog
```

View a list of defined alias:

``` bash
crap list
```

These commands simply find your aliases, and call the Composer commands with the real package names.
If you provided a version constraint when defining your alias, `crap` will use this by default.
You may provide a version constraint on the require and update commands; this will override any default.

The commands `project`, `require`, `update`, and `remove` all accept the same options/flags as the Composer commands that they call.
For reference, see Composer's [Commands documentation][link-composer-docs].

## Why?

I'm lazy.
I tried to create global shell aliases for packages that I used often.
It worked, but if I typed out the full package name, I would get `monolog/monolog/monolog/monolog`.
I also tried to write a Composer plugin, but there was no way to override the incoming package argument.
So, I wrote `crap`.

Oh, the name?
I was going to call it `cra`, and call the main class `Crapp`.
Then I thought of the acronym, and it was just too good not to use.

Yes, it is totally inspired by Spongebob's [POOP].
